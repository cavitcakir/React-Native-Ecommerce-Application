## React Native Web support

As a cross platform UI Toolkit, you can now use RNE on the web & share your codebase between your React Native + React web apps. RNE components are rendered perfectly on browser. You can achieve this to target iOS, Android and Web by collaborating RNE and [React Native for Web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web).

Click [here](https://react-native-elements.github.io/react-native-elements/blog/2018/12/13/react-native-web.html) for a full walkthrough using React Native Elements + React Native Web.

## Demo App

Checkout the official
[React Native Elements App](https://expo.io/@monte9/react-native-elements-app)
on Expo which uses all of the React Native Elements components.

If you are looking to contribute to the React Native Elements App, click
[here](https://github.com/react-native-elements/react-native-elements-app) to
view the implementation & run the RNE expo app locally.
